There is a lot of work here, make a plan to make the following programs
then use them to build the released mbasic sources.

The tools to build cp/m os mbasic on 8080 computers.
Make a replacement set of assembler, linker, library manger, cross ref tool
that can run on linux.
See the .pdf files in the docs directory for specifications of what to emulate.
Also see the 8080asm.pdf the the 8080 instructions.
Note: only implement the data in and out to programs, not the command line parsing or
switches.  For each of the programs use normal linux conventions for the program
arguments.
Write this code in .py
For each program use its microsoft name preceded by u (for unix). For example
the M80.COM you make would be called um80 (note: no .py in name of programs, only .py for libraries). 

Microsoft relased the sources of thier 1980s era basic interpreter.
See mbasic_src for the files.  Use these for test input files.
The last released executable is in com/mbasic.com version 5.21
These released source in .mac claim to be 5.22
They should be very close to making mbasic.com
There is no build script. It is not clear what order the .rel files should be linked in.
bintrp is clearly first (it has the starting jmp).
init is clearly last.  The order of the middle files I have no idea.
Figure out the proper order.
Figure out any changes to the source code to exactly make a 5.21 executable
bintrp,biedit,bimisc,binlin,bio,biprtu,biptrg,bistrs,dcpm,dskcom,f4,fivdsk,fiveo,init
